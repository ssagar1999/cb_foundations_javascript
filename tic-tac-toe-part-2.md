Given the following board variable representing a tic-tac-toe board, update the board to make the winning move for X i.e change one value of the board in such a way that X has a winning move. Do not reassign the value of board to a new array, just update a single element in the nested array.


```js
let board = [[' ', 'O', 'X'],['O', 'X', ' '], ['O', ' ', 'X']]; // Do not modify this line
// Write your code here
console.log(board);
```

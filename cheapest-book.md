# Cheapest Book


Given an array of book objects, return the book object with the cheapest price.
eg.


```js
function findCheapest(books){
// write your code here
}
let listOfBookObj = [
    {title:'Fox In Socks', price:32.20},
    {title:'The Cat In The Hat', price:16.20},
    {title:'Green Eggs and Ham', price:52.50},
    {title:'Thinking Fast and Slow', price:28.80},
    {title:'War and Peace', price: 5.20}
];
console.log(findCheapest(listOfBookObj));
```

should return the  `{title:'War and Peace', price: 5.20}`, in the input list.

## Exercise
Write a function `addGrades` which takes in an array of student objects and adds 'grade' as the new property to each student object which stores the calculated grade (A, B, C, D or E).

```js
let students = [
 { name: 'Vivek', scores: [70, 90, 60, 91] },
 { name: 'Akshat', scores: [90, 80, 80, 60] },
 { name: 'Arnav', scores: [70, 60, 90, 90] },
];

addGrades(students);


```

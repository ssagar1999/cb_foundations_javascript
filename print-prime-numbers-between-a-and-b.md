Given two numbers a and b, you have to print all the prime numbers between them (including them).
Note: a will always be less than b.
Note: You have to reuse the checkPrime function created earlier

```js
// copy the checkPrime function you wrote earlier here

function printPrime(a,b){
 // write your code here
}

printPrime(17, 30);
```
The output should be

```
17
19
23
29
```

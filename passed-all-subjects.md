The passing score is the minimum score needed for a student to pass a subject.
Given the passing score and a student's scores in maths, physics, chemistry and English, 
write a boolean expression to determine if a student has passed all subjects.

```JS
let mathsScore = 81;
let physicsScore = 75;
let chemistryScore = 88;
let englishScore = 100;
let passingScore = 75;

let passedAllSubjects = ; // write your boolean expression here

console.log(passedAllSubjects);
```

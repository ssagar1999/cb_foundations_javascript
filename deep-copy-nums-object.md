```js
let nums = {
    even: [2, 4, 6],
    odd: {
        prime: [3, 5, 7],
        composite: [9, 15]
    }
}
```
1. Create a deep copy of the nums object and name it copyNums
2. Add 8 to the even array in the copyNums object.
3. Add 11 to the prime array in the copyNums object.
4. Print the two objects nums and copyNums. The changes made in the copyNums object must not be reflected in the nums object.

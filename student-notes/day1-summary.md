## Day 1 Overview
* Executing `console.log(value)` will print a value to the console.
* An *operator* takes two values as input and outputs one value.
* Javascript has standard numeric operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`.
* The `%` operator computes the remainder when one number is divided by another.
* Values enclosed in quotes `'` or `"` are called *strings*.
* Digits not enclosed in Strings are called *numbers*.
* The `+` operator will perform *concatenation* if one or both the inputs are strings.
* The `-`, `*` and `/` will implicitly convert any string input to a number.
* If a string cannot be converted to a number it will have a special value `NaN`.
* When there are multiple operations in an expression, *operator precedence* applies :
  * Sub-experessions in brackets are performed first.
  * `*`, `/` and `%` are performed before `+` and `-`.
  * Operators with the same precedence are performed left to right.
* An *expression trace* shows the result of each operation on a separate line.
* When writing a line in the expression trace identify the next operation and rewrite the resulting expression after the operation is performed.
* Use the `let` keyword to define a new variable. This variable can then be used in subsequent expressions.
* A variable which is uninitialized will have a special value `undefined`.

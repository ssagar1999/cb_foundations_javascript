Elections are going on in a state of India called 'Goa'. A person is eligible to vote if they are at least 18 years old and live in Goa. Given a person's age and residence, write code to determine if he or she is eligible to vote or not.

Change the code such that the user can vote (variable canVote is true) if the user intializes the variable residence as Goo, Gaa or 'Goa'.

```js
let age = 22;
let residence = "Goo"; // spelling mistake
let canVote = ; // CHANGE THIS LINE
console.log(canVote); // should print true
```

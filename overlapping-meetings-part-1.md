Two meetings have a start and end time, denoted as hours since midnight.  For example,

- Meeting 1 starts at 8 am and finishes at 12 noon.
- Meeting 2 starts at 11:30 am and finishes at 1:00 pm (13:00).

Write code to calculate whether the two meetings overlap.

Note : meeting 1 will always start before meeting 2

```js
let meeting1Start = 8;
let meeting1End = 12;
let meeting2Start = 11.5;
let meeting2End = 13;
let meetingsOverlap = ;//write your code here
if (meetingsOverlap) {
  console.log('Meetings overlap');
}
else {
  console.log('Meetings do not overlap');
}
```

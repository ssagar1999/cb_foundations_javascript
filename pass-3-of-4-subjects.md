A student's scores for each of the 4 subjects are given.

Given the passing score for each subject, create a boolean variable named `didPassCourse`.

The value of `didPassCourse` will be true if the student passes atleast 3 of the 4 subjects and false otherwise.

**HINT: Use a variable to count the number of courses which were passed.**

```js
let historyScore = 65;
let mathScore = 82;
let englishScore = 90;
let scienceScore = 71;
let passingScore = 70;
let didPassCourse;

// write your code here

if(didPassCourse){
  console.log("Passed");
}
else{
  console.log("Failed");
}
```

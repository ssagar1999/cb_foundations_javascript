# Knight Final Positions

One of the chess soldiers is the `Knight`. A knight can move 2 squares vertically and one horizontally or 2 squares horizontally and one vertically.

If a chess is placed in the corner of the board, write a function called `countFinalPositions` which calculates how many possible squares could the knight end up to in a given number of moves.  

For example, starting from the corner of the board, then it can reach 2 squares as shown here:

```js
function countFinalPositions(numMoves) {
    // write your code here
}

console.log(countFinalPositions(1));// 2


```

Note: The starting cell of the knight is always at the corner of the board.

### Part1

Given two variables age and day, write code to determine the ticket price as per the following rules :
- For a child (age less than 12) the ticket price is always 50. 

- For a senior citizen(age greater than or equal to 65):

      i) if it is weekend (Saturday/Sunday) the price is 70.
      
      ii)if it is a  weekday the price is 80.

- For everybody else the price is always 100. 
```js
let age = 21;
let day = 'Monday';
let price;  

//write your code here to determine the price for the given age and day.

console.log("Ticket price is " + price);
```

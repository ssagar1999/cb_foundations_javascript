Change the code such that the user can vote (variable canVote is true) if the user intializes the variable residence as Goo,Gaa or 'Goa'.

```js
let age = 22;
let residence = "Goo"; // initialized incorrectly (spelling mistake)
let canVote = ; // CHANGE THIS LINE
console.log(canVote); // should print true

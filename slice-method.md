#### Starter code
```js
let alphabets = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'];
let str = "abcdef";
// write your code below this line, don't change anything above this line.

```

### Part1

Use the [slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) method in Javascript to copy a portion of the array starting from the element 'd' till the end of the array into a new array called `part1Array` and print the new array.

Repeat the same operation for the given string variable `str` and store the sliced string into `part1Str`.


### Part2

Use the `slice` method in Javascript to copy a portion of the array 
starting from the element 'c' till the element 'e' into a new array called `part2Array` and print the new array.

Repeat the same operation for the given string variable `str` and store the sliced string into `part2Str`.

### Part3

Use the slice method in Javascript to create a complete copy of the given array `alphabets` and store it in a variable called `copy`

### Part4

Given an email address use the slice method in Javscript to extract the local part (before the @ Symbol) 
and the domain part (after the @ Symbol) in two different Strings.

HINT: use the `indexOf` method to calculate the index of '@'

```js
let email = 'john@example.com';
let atIndex = ; // write your code here
let localPart = ; // write your code here
let domainPart = ; // write your code here
```

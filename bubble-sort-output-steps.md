### Bubble Sort Algorithm
- Please watch the following video to understand the [Bubble Sort Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya7HvQmhoG8)

### Stepwise Implementation of the Bubble Sort Algorithm

If the input is [6,2,9,5,1,3] the steps are:
```
compare 6 and 2 - swap
compare 6 and 9 - no change
compare 9 and 5 - swap
compare 9 and 1 - swap
compare 9 and 3 - swap
REPEAT ITERATION
compare 2 and 6 - no change
compare 6 and 5 - swap 
compare 6 and 1 - swap
compare 6 and 3 - swap
REPEAT ITERATION
compare 2 and 5 - no change
compare 5 and 1 - swap
compare 5 and 3 - swap
REPEAT ITERATION
compare 2 and 1 - swap
compare 2 and 3 - no change
REPEAT ITERATION 
compare 1 and 2 - no change
FINISH
```

If the input is [1,2,9,3,10,7] steps are:
```
compare 1 and 2 - no change
compare 2 and 9 - no change
........
```
- Your task is to complete the remaining steps for the input [1,2,9,3,10,7].
- Please Note that you dont need to perform any further iterations if there is no swap made in the current iteration.

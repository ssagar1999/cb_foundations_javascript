A cinema always gives children (aged less than 12 years) a discount.  
It also gives seniors (aged at least 65) a discount on Mondays and Tuesdays.  
Given the day of week and patrons age, write a boolean expression to calculate if the patron is entitled to a discount.

***CODE TEMPLATE***
****************
```js
let age = 11;
let day = "Tuesday";
let isGivenDiscount = ;  //Write an expression given age and day to calculate if patron is given disount.
console.log(isGivenDiscount);
```
*******************
Note: Please make sure that the first character of the day is a capital letter eg. Monday, Tuesday etc.

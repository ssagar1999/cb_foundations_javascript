Write a funcation called numberSplit which takes one number as a parameter.
The function should return a string containing the two halves of the given number. 
If the number is odd, make the rightmost number higher.

```js
function numberSplit(number){

// write your code here

}
console.log(numberSplit(4));// should print "22"
console.log(numberSplit(10));// should print "55"
console.log(numberSplit(11));// should print "56"
console.log(numberSplit(-9));// should print "-5-4"
```

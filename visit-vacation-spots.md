Create a function that inputs an array of vacation spots and returns an array of elements containing the string "I would love to visit" 
followed by the vacation spot name.

Note: Do not use the 'push' method.

```js
function vacationSpots(spots){
// write your code here
}
let spots= ["Kochi", "Delhi", "Mumbai"];
console.log(vacationSpots(spots));
// should return this array : ["I would love to visit Kochi", "I would love to visit Delhi", "I would love to visit Mumbai"];
```

Given a person's name print the appropriate greeting.

- If the name is undefined, just print the greeting "Good Morning!"
- If the name is mentioned (eg. Mark) , print "Good Morning, Mark!"

For example:
- If the first line is `let name = "Maahi";` then the code should print `Good Morning, Maahi!`
- If the first line is `let name;` then the code should print `Good Morning!`
- If the first line is `let name = 'Rahul';` then the code should print `Good Morning, Rahul!`
- If the first line is `let name = undefined;"` then the code should print `Good Morning!`

Note the exlamation mark at the end of each possible output

```js
let name = "Mark";

// write your code here

```

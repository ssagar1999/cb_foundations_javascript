# JavaScript Problem Solving for Coding Blocks Students

Welcome to the **JavaScript Problem Solving** repository! ðŸŽ‰ This repository is a treasure trove of JavaScript problems, meticulously curated to help Coding Blocks students sharpen their coding skills and apply them to real-world scenarios.



## Introduction
Hello, budding developers! ðŸ‘‹ This repository is designed to be your go-to resource for practicing JavaScript. Whether you're just starting out or looking to deepen your understanding, these problems will challenge you and enhance your problem-solving abilities. Each problem is crafted to simulate real-life coding scenarios, ensuring that the skills you develop here will be directly applicable in your coding journey.

## Getting Started
Ready to dive in? Follow these steps to get started:

3. **Install Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Problems
The problems are neatly organized into categories for your convenience. Each category addresses different aspects of JavaScript programming, from basic syntax to complex algorithms.

### Categories
- **Arrays**: Dive into problems that deal with array manipulation, searching, sorting, and more.
- **Strings**: Tackle problems involving string operations, pattern matching, and text processing.
- **Objects**: Work with problems focused on object manipulation, key-value pairs, and prototypes.
- **Functions**: Explore function-based problems, including closures, higher-order functions, and callbacks.
- **Algorithms**: Challenge yourself with algorithmic problems that require logical thinking and optimization.
- **Data Structures**: Engage with problems on various data structures like stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees.

## How to Use
1. **Select a Problem**: Browse through the categories and pick a problem that interests you.
2. **Read the Problem Statement**: Each problem has a `README.md` file with a detailed description of the problem, expected input and output, and examples.
3. **Implement Your Solution**: Write your solution in the provided JavaScript file. Feel free to create additional helper functions if needed.
4. **Test Your Solution**: Test your code with different inputs to ensure it works correctly. Use the provided test cases as a starting point, and add more if necessary.

## Contributing
We love contributions! ðŸ¥³ If you have a problem or a solution that you think would benefit other students, we encourage you to contribute ad your solutios after forking it.
